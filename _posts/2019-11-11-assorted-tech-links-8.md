I do quite a bit of reading and watching of tech talks and since I often forget things, I decided to turn this into a sort of bookmarking service.

- I love to listen to data architecture descriptions and I love it ever more when the bottom line is: we just use Postgres (usually heavily partitioned). There are a few podcast episodes on these, there's [Outlier](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/06/29/data-engineering-automation-with-mike-kim/), [Pex](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/06/22/video-search-with-rasty-turek/) or [Heap](https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/heap-with-dan-robinson-episode-36/).
- I can highly recommend all of Kyle Kingsbury's talks. He built this testing suite, Jepsen, which verifies data stores and checks them for consistency guarantees, data loss, split brain, dirty reads, ... Oh and [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRc0O9VgzB0) includes zings like “Turns out the write ahead log wasn’t write ahead.” If you're not fluent in this terminology, I can highly recommend [Martin Kleppmann's book](http://dataintensive.net/).
- A great talk by the creator of Node.js. [What he regrets and what he’d do differently.](https://youtu.be/M3BM9TB-8yA)
- I saw this quite a while ago, but I remember it being quite cool. Scott Hansleman is diabetic, but doesn't like the commercial hardware and software used to track his blood sugar level. [He talks at length about making is own, open device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNhYhlBQoEY), with a gazillion caveats, of course.
- I dislike all things Java/JVM, but I'm always astonished at Elasticsearch's performance. [In this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ-rXP-D80U&feature=share), Adrien Grand describes at length what sort of data structures and algorithms are used in Elasticsearch and Lucene.
