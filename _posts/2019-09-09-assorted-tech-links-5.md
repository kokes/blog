I do quite a bit of reading and watching of tech talks and since I often forget things, I decided to turn this into a sort of bookmarking service.

- You don't have to have fancy math across all your slides, I much prefer clear talks with good examples. [Robert Rodger's talk on text summarisation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ5BEKVxy9k) is just that. I actually saw this one live, it was great.
- Building containters from scratch. Like, from basically nothing. [It's very clear, well paced, instructive.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fi7uSYlOdc)
- I'm not a huge fan of dependencies, I like to have functionality baked into the runtime that I'm using and only choose a handful of must-have dependencies, I have my reasons. And I'm not the only one, [here's a good post](https://todd.ginsberg.com/post/the-art-of-picking-dependencies/) on picking dependencies responsibly.
- TDD has become almost a religion. Here's a great talk on [where it all went wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM). Ian Cooper covers the origins - like red-green-refactor - but also the bad practices we've come to adopt, the most prominent one being that we tend to test implementations rather than behaviour. Once you factor in your implementation details into your test, you've deviated from the original idea of TDD.
- UTC, just use UTC. [Turns out, it's not quite a universal advice as it might seem.](https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2019/03/27/storing-utc-is-not-a-silver-bullet/)
