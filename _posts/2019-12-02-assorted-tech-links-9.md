I do quite a bit of reading and watching of tech talks and since I often forget things, I decided to turn this into a sort of bookmarking service.

- Writing assembly is tough, I'd never go that road. But I've just found out that even people proficient in assembly use tooling that helps build it. There's a Python tool and a Go tool, [here's a good introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Y5CZ7_tyA4&feature=share). The speaker also has a fun post about [absurd optimisations](https://mmcloughlin.com/posts/geohash-assembly).
- Shortly after Microsoft announced its aquisition of Github, Gitlab's founder and CEO, Sid Sijbrandij, [went on The Architecht's Show](http://architechtshow.com/ep-60-gitlab-ceo-on-competing-with-microsoft-betting-on-kubernetes-and-learning-to-scale) to talk all things Gitlab and their competition.
- “If you’re listening to this podcast and you’re not using containers and you feel bad about it... please don’t.” Another great episode one realises that you don't have to be at the cutting edge of technology to function just fine. https://hanselminutes.com/645/container-catharsis-with-laura-frank-tacho
- Rewriting software always leads to broken deadlines, new bugs everywhere, reinventing the wheels etc. I've done this a few times and it was always the same. Here's [a good overview of how a lot larger rewrites turned out](https://medium.com/@herbcaudill/lessons-from-6-software-rewrite-stories-635e4c8f7c22).
- I tried out Presto for a few workloads and I was incredibly impressed. It's a great piece of software and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2C-iYNm2wU) offers a really nice overview of its architecture and how it differs from Spark.
