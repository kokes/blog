I do quite a bit of reading and watching of tech talks and since I often forget things, I decided to turn this into a sort of bookmarking service.

- With Python 2 about to be deprecated, there are a few talks about migration to Python 3. There's Facebook's take [from PyCon 2018](https://youtu.be/H4SS9yVWJYA) and Instagram's [from PyCon 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66XoCk79kjM). Oh and the most recent now - how [Pinterest did the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1vqfBEAkNA&feature=share) - it's a bit more about the code differences rather than how they actually migrated.
- I expected a dry talk on code reviews and it ended up being [a really nice overview of culture, soft skills, helping newcomers, dealing with anxiety, GTD etc](https://youtu.be/iNG1a--SIlk).
- Forget PEP8, version control, reviews or tests. No bash, subprocess run all the things, just good old sloppy code that *solves your problem*. [Super fast and excellent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd8ulMb6_ls).
- This is [a useful reminder](https://blog.jooq.org/2019/04/09/the-difference-between-sqls-join-on-clause-and-the-where-clause/) that where conditions in SQL are quite different from conditions on joins.
- This is a classic. [Why is GNU grep so fast?](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-current/2010-August/019310.html) It does very little and it does this to as few bytes as possible. These advice apply to a much wider number of situations.
