I do quite a bit of reading and watching of tech talks and since I often forget things, I decided to turn this into a sort of bookmarking service.

- Raymond Hettinger is a core Python developer, he's quite known for being a great speaker and educator. Here's [a talk on Python dictionaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33CVV29OG8), how they came up to be, how their implementation changed over the years and what it means for their users.
- Code reviews are essential, but that doesn't mean we have to do PEP8 and other code quality checks by hand. [Automate these away as much as possible.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1lDk_WKXvY)
- Dependency management is hard. Here are [a few notes from the creator of pipenv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBQAKldqgZs). I'm still not entirely sold on pipenv, but I do tend to use it, because it's nicely built into our deployment flow.
- The one and only Jake VanderPlas and [his tips and tricks regarding well performing numerical code in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQeYx87mfyw).
- Learned indexes sound a bit like magic. Instead of being explicitly set up like regular indexes, these are inferred from data and can perform better. But it's better explain by one of the authors, [Tim Kraska](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkIHC7xMSRQ) or perhaps [by Robert Rodgers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0q9mxMekBeE).
