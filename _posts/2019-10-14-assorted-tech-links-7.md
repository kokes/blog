I do quite a bit of reading and watching of tech talks and since I often forget things, I decided to turn this into a sort of bookmarking service.

- I'm not a huge fan of overhyped parts of ML/AI, so I welcomed [this sober post](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/06/22/ways-to-think-about-machine-learning-8nefy).
- Not everything has to be centralised. This is one of the rarest use cases for complex technology, Chick-fil-A installed Kubernetes at the edge, since the internet is unstable (plus a few other reasons). There's [an article](https://medium.com/@cfatechblog/edge-computing-at-chick-fil-a-7d67242675e2) and [a video with slides](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/chick-fil-a-k8-clusters).
- Lessons learned from [a Kubernetes outage at Monzo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUYTNywPk-s). And it's not the only Kubernetes post mortem, there's [a whole list of them](https://github.com/hjacobs/kubernetes-failure-stories).
- Crash early, crash often. [Good tips](https://medium.com/@mattklein123/crash-early-and-crash-often-for-more-reliable-software-597738dd21c5) from the author of [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/).
- [Linear models are awesome](https://youtu.be/68ABAU_V8qI), Iâ€™m glad someone can explain that with such rigour. Also, I thought I had too many slides, but I just witnessed Vincent go through 145 slides in 35 minutes.
