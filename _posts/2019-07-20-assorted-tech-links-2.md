I do quite a bit of reading and watching of tech talks and since I often forget things, I decided to turn this into a sort of bookmarking service.

- I like Joel Grus, he [live streams himself live coding Advent of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPXXthwAdg8&list=PLeDtc0GP5ICklPBnoZ0fdrw130hxI6_b3), he has written a cool book on Data Science (the second edition [has just been released](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-from/9781492041122/)) and... he [doesn't like Jupyter notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U). It's a good thing that this is talked about, because notebooks are almost universally praised, but people should know about the downsides, too.
- I've been using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on and off for quite a while, but I still don't use any advanced features. Here's [a EuroPython talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YLMWU-5H9o) on some of its advanced features (not just) related to Python.
- If you working with Spark, chances are you've read something from Jacek Laskowski, he maintains [a few sites on the internals of Spark or Kafka](https://github.com/jaceklaskowski), these are really good resources relating to underdocumented pieces of code. One fairly recent addition to Spark is bucketing and Jacek [had a nice Spark Summit talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv7IIYuQOXI) on the topic.
- There are tons of interesting data structures and algorithms, Nicholas Ormrod covers a few of them in [this great CppCon talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA-nB2wjVcI). I highly recommend the last part where he talks about [HyperLogLog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog), an algorithm which is very close to magic. Oh and I also gave a talk on HyperLogLog and similar algorithms at [this year's PyData Amsterdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ean3Bx_o_M).
- I've been compiling these lists of links based on my notes and one of my notes says just "Chandler Carruth". Not sure if I was referring to a specific talk, but I watched [nearly all his talks from CppCons](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=chandler+carruth), because his captivating narrative is really fun to watch. I don't write any C++, but the principles covered in these talks are mostly universal.
