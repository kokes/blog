- Instructions can be essentially free [if you're waiting for your memory to catch up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEG4Qyo_4Bc&feature=share). Here's [a bit of a deep dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP6NxVxDQIs) from a past CppCon. And [here's how you measure it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXaxk27zwlk&feature=youtu.be), by Chandler Carruth, one of my favourite speakers.
- I've gotten into the habit of writing post mortems whenever I screw up. This came from reading [Dan Luu's writeup](https://danluu.com/postmortem-lessons/). There's also an accompanying repo with [a list of post mortems](https://github.com/danluu/post-mortems).
- This is a bit dated video [about the future of pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gJtO0XR48) but some of it still applies and it goes to show that it's still evolving and that there are changes to come.
- We're all used to REST now, but GRPC is making strides. Here's [a good overview](https://youtu.be/RoXT_Rkg8LA) of how it differs from REST, WSDL, Thrift etc.
- [You are not Google.](https://blog.bradfieldcs.com/you-are-not-google-84912cf44afb) Sure, we all know that... but do we?
